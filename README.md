# hostctl

Hostctl is an opinionated command line tool for easily provisioning cloud VMs.

Hostctl is ideal for spinning up VMs for development or personal use. It does
nothing more than manage VM hosts, so if you need anything else you should look
at cloud provider specific tools. It's not intended for managing production
clusters, as you should be using a tool like [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) instead.

## Getting hostctl

Until the first release, you can get hostctl with `go get`:

    $ go get github.com/progrium/hostctl
